# Final-Year-project 
The purpose of the given project is to develop a system that can classify type of particular cancer based on MRI and CT images, also can find out the more appropriate diagnosis methods for different image modalities and can analyze the relationship between various types of cancer. Therefore, before analyzing the images, they should be filtered by segmentation and noise removal. Then, the basic machine learning algorithms, such as follows:
· Principal Component Analysis 
· Linear Discriminative Analysis 
· Independent Component Analysis 
· Feed Forward Neural Network 
· Feed Forward Black Propagation Neural Network 
· Convolutional Neural Network 
· Support Vector Machine will be applied to the dataset in order to classify the nature of the cancer.
